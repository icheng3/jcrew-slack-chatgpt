    "item_name": "Melange Collection crocodile ornament",
    "description": "Melange Collection is a handmade brand that specializes in heirloom-quality holiday d\u00e9cor. This fun crocodile ornament is made in Guatemala of durable glass beads. Ornaments are made by a women's cooperative in a small village on the shores of Lake Atitl\u00e1n in Guatemala. The women work in small groups to produce these designs. The glass beads are placed in a multicolored pile upon a flat surface in front of each woman, and are picked up on needles held between each one's thumb and index finger in a process so quick and precise that it seems like sleight of hand. As beads accrue, the sculpture emerges. Beaders must learn to weave or sculpt each new design separately, and to achieve the uniformity necessary, they must memorize hundreds of steps for each figure."

Our oxford is made from American Pima cotton, a species that has longer fibers than other varieties of cotton which makes it stronger, softer and less likely to pill. As an added bonus, it's engineered with mechanical stretch: the 100 percent cotton fabric is woven loosely, then washed, giving it natural elasticity without having any stretch fibers. We kept the collar unlined and a little on the long side, a nod to its Ivy League heritage. (Fun fact: Yale, Harvard and Cambridge also had shirt fabrics named after them, but none have stood the test of time as well as Oxford's.)"
